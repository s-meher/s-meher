## About Me

I’m a CS major at Illinois Institute of Technology with experience building backend systems, analytics workflows, and internal tools that support real business and operational decisions. I enjoy translating ambiguous problems into structured, data-driven solutions and working across technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Alongside my technical background, I’m preparing for **CFA Level I**, which strengthens my understanding of finance, risk, and decision frameworks. Long-term, I’m interested in roles where technology and data are used to drive impact in analytics, consulting, solutions engineering, or business-facing technical teams.
